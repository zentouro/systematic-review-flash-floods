## Systematic Review Software

An R-shiny App to make systematically reviewing easier in the Natural and Social Sciences. 

This app is still very much in development, but feel free to share and use! Let us know if you have any suggestions. 


### How to use
Working on a systematic review? Here's our current workflow. 

#### Step 1

Create your screening data using `Set-up code.R`
While creating this file, take some time to think through what information and questions you'll be asking for this analysis. We recommend constructing a series of Yes/No questions you can ask of every abstract. Here are ours:

```
1. Is the paper relevant to flash flooding or hydrology in general? (If NO - Not Relevant)
2. If Yes, is the paper about more than the underlying hydrology behind flooding (If NO - Hydrology)
3. If Yes the paper will likely be included in our analysis. What kind of paper is it?
    1. Is the paper primarily geophysically focused ()? Or socio-politically/impact focused?  (Select appropriate toggle, it can be both)
    2. Is the paper about an event? (If YES - Event)
4. Does the paper disaggregate by flood type? (if NO - Not Disaggregated)
5. Is the paper extremely relevant to our analysis and questions about the impact and vulnerability associated with flash floods? (If YES - Review Database) 
```

These questions directly inform the columns we created during the screening data set-up. 

#### Step 2

With questions and screening data in hand, using `MainSystReviewCode.R` you can begin the screening process.
Adjust the text in the shiny app to align with your questions and columns. And go to town reviewing papers. 

##### Step 2A - How we keep organized

After finishing a screening session, I recommend copying the `screeningData.rData` file into the `03_backup-screening-data` directory. Should I make this happen automatically? Yes. Have I done that yet. No. Maybe once I've finished actually doing the systematic review.
